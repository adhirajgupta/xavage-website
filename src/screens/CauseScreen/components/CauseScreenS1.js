            <p>
            For <b>over two decades</b>, our school has proudly organized events with a strong commitment to giving back, donating all profits to charitable organizations. In just the last three years, TISB has donated <b>over â‚¹30 lakhs</b> to these causes. Given the freedom and privilege we enjoy to host such events, it is our prerogative to contribute to the greater good. Through these efforts, we aim to instill the values of compassion and social responsibility in our students while making a meaningful difference in the lives of others.
